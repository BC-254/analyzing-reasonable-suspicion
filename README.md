# **TERRY TRAFFIC STOPS TO ARREST PREDICTION** 
<img src= 'Images/Police_stop.webp' >

## **Overview**
Traffic stops are usually made by the police whenever they detect suspicious drivers. However, as much as suspicion exists, not all stops lead to a formal arrest since it may be a situation of mistaken identity or just a false call.This project leverages over 65,000 Seattle Police Department records to predict arrest outcomes, providing a viable data-driven tool for auditing law enforcement transparency. By analyzing the available robust features, the model successfully navigates class imbalance to identify the key factors driving police decision-making.

## **Business Understanding**
This project seeks to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast whether a traffic stop will result in an arrest. This model aims to assist law enforcement agencies in making informed decisions during traffic stops hence ensuring that adequate resources have been allocated effectively and that officers are better prepared for potential outcomes. Nonetheless, the model seeks to enhance transparency and accountability within law enforcement by providing insights into the factors that influence arrest decisions.
